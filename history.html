            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Started in 2018 by an enthusiastic sophomore named Hiba Morrar, initially simply known as “The LionBots”, garnered momentum in our rookie year for passionate students interested in engineering and design outside the classroom.</p>
            <p>Despite the hiatus during the pandemic, LionBot Robotics was revived for the RAPID REACT 2022 FRC season by previous members. The beginning of this season marked a new era of The LionBots, with new members and a new, passionate lead mentor. The spirit of The LionBots was reignited, which led us to receive the Judges Award at the San Francisco Regional as a result of our perseverance and growth mindset, with assistance from fellow teams, including the Spartans (Team 971) and the Alameda Aztechs (Team 4186). With the grant of this award, the whole team was extremely proud of our accomplishment. After this season, our member count was cut in half as a result of the departure of our graduating seniors.</p>
            <p>Despite this large foundational change, for the CHARGED UP 2023 FRC season, the team experienced a grand rebuilding and restructuring, onboarding many new members, along with two new supporting mentors. As a result of the large population of new members, we volunteered at CalGames 2022, a yearly off-season robotics competition to introduce our rookie members to FRC, and to give back to our local FIRST community. However, during the build season, we experienced many problems, including shipping delays, inaccessibility to machine tools, and the campus being closed for repairs. Fortunately, the Spartans (Team 971) graciously provided their school workspace for us to work on our robot. Subsequently, we were awarded the Team Spirit award at the San Francisco Regional for our healthy team culture and perseverance through adversity.</p>
            <p>The 2024 FRC season proved to be our most successful season to date, with a highly student-led team, new experiences for everyone involved, and more involvement with the FRC community. For the CRESCENDO 2024 FRC season, we focused heavily on recruiting new members, as we again had a large graduating class the year prior. With our new, highly diverse team, CalGames 2023 was another important opportunity to introduce new members to the FRC community, as well as to provide previous members with another opportunity to compete. Afterward, our new members participated in an all-rookies, smaller-scale, community-designed off-season competition, called Mechanical M-Ayhem. This allowed the student leads to provide numerous teaching opportunities to prepare the students for the official, season competitions. Additionally, the 2024 competition season resulted in our most outstanding seasons. While we continued to face shipping delays, this season brought many new successes as well, including the completion of the mechanical aspect of our robot before our first competition, improved project management and organization, and a clear direction for our robot. Despite these developments, our performance at the San Francisco Regional (SFR) opened our eyes to certain skills that our team and robot were lacking. We ended the competition with a ranking of 32 out of 43 teams in qualification matches. Yet, the competition proved to be a great learning experience for everyone on the team. We learned to appreciate clear communication, attention to detail, time management, and additional considerations for our robot design. We took the lessons learned from SFR to East Bay Regional (EBR). In EBR, a monumental milestone was marked for us, where we ranked the highest in the team's history, with a final qualification ranking of 18 out of 60 teams. Though the official season ended for the LionBots, we continued participating in off-season competitions, including an inaugural off-season competition, Sunset Showdown. On the USS Hornet, the LionBots had a stellar performance, being picked for a playoff alliance for the first time in the team's history! Largely playing a supportive role to other alliance members, our team had a cohesive, well-structured plan to score as highly as possible. Despite the problems we've experienced, we feel that we're always working towards greater feats.
