    <h2>We Are Team #7245!</h2>
    <p> 
        <p style="text-align: center;">Founded: 2018 <br> 
            Location: Kipp King Collegiate High School <br>
            2005 Via Barrett <br> <br></p>
            LionBot Robotics is a FRC Team #7245, a club full of aspiring STEM students. We would meet 2-3 times a week to plan, build, and revise plans related to improving the robotics experience. Our purpose is to educate and inspire students to take their first steps into STEM and create an atmosphere that can be, in ways, relatable to STEM field experiences. We design and code robots that would later compete in competitions to solve challenging engineering design problems. We manage our budget and finances when it comes to saving and limitations as well as obtaining fundraising throughout the school year. Our hope is to make learning about robotics and STEM as fun and enjoyable as possible to anyone with the right mindset.
